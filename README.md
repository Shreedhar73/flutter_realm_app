# realm_test

A new Flutter project to test realm db.

Realm is a fast, scalable alternative to SQLite with mobile to cloud data sync that makes building real-time, reactive mobile apps easy.
Realm is supported by Mongo DB and helps to store data locally and sync it with Mongo DB atlas.

Unlike firestore, realm provides offline first approach, such that we can store data mapped with schema locally and later sync it with cloud database provided by mongo db.
